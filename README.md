# New York Taxi Fare Prediction

The reading sequence is:
 1. data preprocessing and visualization
 2. Further feature engineering
 3. Baseline model
 4. LGBM

Summary of data analysis
Part one: data preprocessing and visualization

■ Extracted and cleaned data
  
■  Introduced data structure and content
  
■  Separated the occurrence time of each ride into detailed features.
  
■  Investigated the distribution of ride fare amounts and its relationship 
  with different features.
  
 
Part two: Further feature engineering:

■  Calculated the haversine distances between pickup and dropoff locations based on 
  their latitude and longitude values.
  
■  Detaily investigated the distribution of taxi ride fare with locations
  

Part three: Baseline model:

■  Built a simple linear regression model as a baseline.
  

Part four: LGBM:

■  Built and tuned a Light Gradient Boosting model to train and fit the data.
  
■  Acheived a significant improvement compared to the baseline model.
